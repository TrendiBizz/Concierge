# Rust port status (`concierge-core`)

Rule: the Python in `api/app` stays deployed and untouched until a Rust module has passed parity and been
deliberately wired in and redeployed. Nothing here has been deployed.

Parity method: `parity/gen_vectors.py` runs the live Python modules and writes `parity/vectors.json`;
`tests/parity.rs` must reproduce every vector. Run `cargo test` in this directory.

| Python module | Rust module | Status |
|---|---|---|
| chunking.py | chunking | ported, 375 vectors match |
| guard.py (quote guard) | guard | ported, 300 vectors match |
| contact.py | contact | ported, 52 vectors match |
| unsub.py | unsub | ported, tokens byte-identical |
| ical.py | ical | ported, feed byte-identical |
| security.py RateLimiter | rate_limit | ported (unit test) |
| scoring, sla, booking (pure parts), quotations, outbox, events, tools, main (HTTP) | not started | next batches |

Known, documented differences: `\s` in the paragraph splitter follows Rust/Unicode White_Space semantics for the
chunker's regex-free splitter only where Python agrees (the vectors include U+2003, U+3000, U+00A0); phone digit
filtering uses ASCII digits only (Python `\D` also treats non-ASCII decimal digits as digits).

## Not fixable by code (needs a person or a provider)
1. Incoming SMS from another phone to the business number.
2. Human microphone conversation on the website.
3. Separate guest inbox receiving a calendar invitation (needs a second authorized address).
4. Real business hours (owner input) before public booking is enabled.
5. Google OAuth production verification (Google console action by the account owner).
6. Unattended SMS: the Mac requires a Send confirmation; a hosted SMS provider would be a purchase.
